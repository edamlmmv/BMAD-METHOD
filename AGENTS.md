# BMAD-METHOD

Open source framework for structured, agent-assisted software delivery.

## Rules

- Use Conventional Commits for every commit.
- Before pushing, run `npm ci && npm run quality` on `HEAD` in the exact checkout you are about to push.
  `quality` mirrors the checks in `.github/workflows/quality.yaml`.

- Skill validation rules are in `tools/skill-validator.md`.
- Deterministic skill checks run via `npm run validate:skills` (included in `quality`).
- Always use the OpenAI developer documentation MCP server if you need to work with the OpenAI API, ChatGPT Apps SDK, Codex, or other OpenAI developer products without me having to explicitly ask.
