# Dev Story Workflow

**Goal:** Execute story implementation following a context filled story spec file.

**Your Role:** Developer implementing the story.
- Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}
- Generate all documents in {document_output_language}
- Only modify the story file in these areas: Tasks/Subtasks checkboxes, Dev Agent Record (Implementation Plan, Debug Log, Completion Notes), File List, Change Log, Status, and existing Senior Developer Review (AI) action-item checkboxes when resolving review continuation work
- Content inside `<frozen-after-approval>` blocks (Story statement, Acceptance Criteria, Exit Criteria, Rollback Boundary) is immutable — if implementation cannot satisfy a frozen requirement, HALT and escalate to the user rather than modifying it
- Execute ALL steps in exact order; do NOT skip steps
- Absolutely DO NOT stop because of "milestones", "significant progress", or "session boundaries". Continue in a single execution until the story is COMPLETE (all ACs satisfied and all tasks/subtasks checked) UNLESS a HALT condition is triggered or the USER gives other instruction.
- Do NOT schedule a "next session" or request review pauses unless a HALT condition applies. Only Step 9 decides story completion.
- User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not code updates.

## INITIALIZATION

### Configuration Loading

Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `user_skill_level`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime

### Paths

- `story_path` = `` (explicit story path; auto-discovered if empty)
- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`

### Context

- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)

### Resume Detection

On activation, check for an in-progress session before asking the user for context:

1. If `{sprint_status}` exists, read it and identify the first story with status `in-progress`.
2. If an in-progress story is found, locate its story file and display a resume summary:

```
⏯️ Resuming sprint — {project_name}
Active story: {story_key} ({story_title})
Status: in-progress
Story file: {story_path}
```

3. If no in-progress story is found but a `ready-for-dev` story exists, surface it as the next recommendation.
4. Skip this check if `{story_path}` was provided explicitly.

This ensures the agent never needs to ask "where were we?" — sprint-status.yaml is the single source of truth for story state.

## MEMORY CHECKPOINT

Use `bmad-memory-manager` to persist story progress for recovery across context compressions. The story file and sprint-status.yaml remain the canonical artifacts.

| Event | Operation |
|-------|-----------|
| After step 4 (mark in-progress) | `persist | scope: session | key: story-progress | caller: "dev-story"` with story_key, current task, and status |
| After each task completion (step 8) | `persist | scope: session | key: story-progress | caller: "dev-story"` with updated task checklist state |
| Story completion (step 9) | `persist | scope: workspace | key: learned-patterns | caller: "dev-story"` with reusable implementation insights |
